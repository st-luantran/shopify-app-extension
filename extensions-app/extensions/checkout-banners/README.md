## Set expectations with custom banner messages

With the rising cost of new customer acquisition, itâ€™s critical for brands to earn and maintain trust with their customers, especially during the checkout process. This trust will help set clear expectations with buyers and ensure that they have all relevant information before completing a purchase.

Custom banner messages allow you to include important information for buyers right on the checkout page, so there are no surprises as they move through the buying process.

Common examples of custom banner messages that brands display in checkout include:

Sharing which items are not eligible for returns or exchanges
Highlighting any potential shipping delays
Notifying buyers about special circumstances to be aware of, such as holiday turnaround times
Showcasing industry-specific trust badges, testimonials, or quotes
By leveraging checkout UI extensions, you can quickly build multiple versions of custom banners that render at the Checkout::Dynamic::Render extension point within the checkout. Best of all, you can choose a specific location in checkout for the banner to show, or give merchants the choice to determine where and how these banners should be displayed using the checkout editor.
